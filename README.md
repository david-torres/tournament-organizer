## Bracket Visualization [TODO]

To visualize the bracket of a tournament, open `bracket.html` in your browser, and update the `API_BASE_URL` and `tournamentId` variables in `bracket.js` to match your API server and desired tournament ID.

## Running the Simulation Script

You can run the `simulateTournament.js` script to simulate the entire flow of adding members, creating a tournament, participants joining, generating matches, and randomly assigning winners until the tournament is complete:

    node simulateTournament.js

A large amount of this code was generated by ChatGPT (GPT-4). That said, it was pretty buggy and broken and I had to fix it up a fair amount to get it usable. See the [prompt](gpt-prompt.txt).
