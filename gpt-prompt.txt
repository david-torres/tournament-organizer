create a javascript REST API. This API will facilitate creating and managing Tournaments, Participants, and Matches. Data should be stored in an SQLite database. Support the following features:
- create new members. members participate in tournaments.
- create single elimination tournaments. members may opt to participate in tournaments.
- generate matches
- generate bracket graphic
- track member Elo score across matches and tournaments.

Perform these actions one at a time. I will prompt for the next action by saying, "next action"
Describe the database schema and produce a script to generate it.
Describe the API endpoints that will comprise this service.
Produce a Swagger document that will call the endpoints described.
Outline the files necessary to achieve our goal.
I will then prompt you to produce each file.
